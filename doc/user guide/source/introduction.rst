Welcome to the CoderDojo Mobile Toolbox User Guide! Usage by regular Ninja / Mentors during the sessions should be straightforward, so this guide's intended audience is Mentors / Champions who need to set up the system.

Depending on your needs, you might need to configure just a subset of the toolbox' features.

Currently, the two main features are learning material/tools, and events. Their configuration is mainly performed using the Django Admin site.
The first step is performed as shown in the `django user guide`_.
